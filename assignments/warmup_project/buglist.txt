Buglist:
	Robot waves towards and away from the wall
	The obstacle avoid circle is centered on the lidar, which is set back on the bot, making it do crappy obstacle in front of it for small circles
	Occasionally the smach_server has a dictionary change size in FOLLOW as it's being used
	I implemented a basic corner turner after losing the wall, but it doesn't work smoothly
